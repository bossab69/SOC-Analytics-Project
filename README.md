# SOC-Analytics-Project
SOC ANALYTICS &amp; INCIDENT DETECTION

Project Overview

This project simulates the work of a Tier 1 SOC Analyst. It focuses on collecting, analyzing, and correlating security logs to detect suspicious activities, investigate incidents, and recommend remediation steps.

The project demonstrates hands-on experience with security monitoring, traffic analysis, and alert investigation using realistic SOC workflows.

Objectives

Monitor system and network activity

Detect suspicious or malicious behavior

Analyze security logs and traffic

Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)

Produce an incident response report



---

Tools & Technologies

Kali Linux

Wireshark

Nmap

Python (log parsing & analysis)

VirtualBox / VMware

Sample log files (Apache, auth.log, firewall logs)



---

Project Setup

Created a virtual lab using Kali Linux and a target VM

Generated network traffic and simulated suspicious activities (port scans, brute force attempts)

Captured and analyzed traffic using Wireshark

Collected system and authentication logs for analysis



---

Key Activities Performed

Analyzed network traffic to identify scanning and enumeration behavior

Detected brute-force login attempts through log correlation

Identified unusual IP addresses and abnormal traffic patterns

Classified alerts based on severity (Low, Medium, High)

Documented findings and response actions



---

Sample Security Findings

Multiple failed login attempts indicating brute-force attack

Unauthorized port scanning activity from external IPs

Suspicious DNS queries and abnormal traffic volume
